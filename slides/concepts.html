      <li>Canonicality by convention <blockquote><p>I certainly agree that almost any project will want a "central" repository in the sense that you want to have one canonical default source base that people think of as the "primary" source base.

But that should not be a *technical* distinction, it should be a *social* one, if you see what I mean.

Distribution doesn't mean that you cannot have central places - but it means that you can have *different* central places for different things.</p></blockquote><cite><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/246381/">Linus Himself</a></cite></li>
